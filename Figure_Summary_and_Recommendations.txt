IMPROVED FIGURES FOR AS SURVEY MANUSCRIPT
==========================================

I've successfully created three improved figures based on the expert recommendations. Here's what was implemented and some additional suggestions:

FIGURE 1: A National Leadership Preparedness Gap in Pediatric AS Training
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This composite figure combines what were previously Figures 1A and 1B into a powerful single visual that tells the complete story of the leadership preparedness gap.

PART A: THE CAREER FUNNEL
- Shows the dramatic drop-off from fellow interest (~35% of programs report 51-100% of fellows interested) to actual career placement (~11% of programs report 51-100% placed in AS positions)
- Uses large, bold numbers and visual flow (funnel with arrow) to make the gap immediately apparent
- Color-coded: Blue for interest (optimistic), Red for career outcomes (concern)
- Highlights the ~24% gap with a prominent annotation

PART B: THE SATISFACTION GAP (DIVERGING STACKED BAR CHART)
- Uses best-practice diverging stacked bar chart for Likert scale data
- Negative responses (dissatisfied) extend left from center
- Positive responses (satisfied) extend right from center
- Neutral responses are split at the center line
- Shows clear visual progression:
  * "General education/background knowledge": Heavily weighted right (satisfied)
  * "Ability to use AS in clinical practice": Still positive but slightly less
  * "Ability to assume a leadership role in AS": Much more balanced, showing the gap

KEY INSIGHT: The visual immediately communicates that while programs are satisfied with foundational knowledge, there's significant concern about leadership preparedness.


FIGURE 2: Impact of a Formal Curriculum on Fellow Participation in AS Interventions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This dumbbell plot (also called connected dot plot) replaces the grouped bar chart.

DESIGN FEATURES:
- Each AS intervention is listed on the y-axis
- Two dots per intervention: one for "with curriculum" (blue), one for "without curriculum" (red)
- Line connecting the dots shows the participation gap
- Sorted by gap size (largest to smallest) for maximum impact
- Top 3 gaps are annotated with delta values

KEY FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED:
1. Education of residents/faculty: 26.5% gap (largest)
2. Antibiotic Timeout: 17.6% gap  
3. Antibiotic Approval: 10.6% gap

ADVANTAGE OVER BAR CHART: The eye is immediately drawn to the length of the connecting lines, making comparisons effortless. You can instantly see which interventions benefit most from a formal curriculum.


FIGURE 3: Limited Educator Time is the Primary Barrier to AS Education
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This simple horizontal bar chart replaces what was Figure 5.

DESIGN FEATURES:
- Barriers ranked from highest to lowest percentage
- Clean, uncluttered design focuses attention on the ranking
- Color gradient (subtle) adds visual interest without distraction
- Value labels positioned outside bars for easy reading
- Top barrier (educator time) emphasized with dashed red box

KEY FINDING: "Lack of educator time" is reported by 44.4% of programs - nearly 11 percentage points higher than the next barrier ("Lack of materials" at 33.3%)

RATIONALE FOR SIMPLIFICATION: Since both program types (with/without curriculum) faced similar barriers, comparing them added visual clutter without insight. The simple ranked chart delivers the key message more effectively.


ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS
=======================

1. FIGURE LEGENDS AND CAPTIONS
   - Each figure should have a comprehensive caption explaining:
     * What the data represents
     * Sample size (n=27 programs)
     * Any statistical tests performed
     * Key takeaways highlighted in the caption
   
2. STATISTICAL ANNOTATIONS
   Consider adding statistical significance markers to Figure 2 (dumbbell plot):
   - If you have p-values from chi-square or Fisher's exact tests
   - Mark significant differences with asterisks (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001)
   - This would strengthen the argument that formal curricula make a real difference

3. CONSISTENCY IN COLOR SCHEME
   - Current figures use:
     * Blue (#2C7BB6) for positive/desired outcomes
     * Red (#D7191C) for concerns/gaps
   - This could be standardized across all figures for consistency
   - Consider using your institution's colors if submitting internally first

4. FIGURE RESOLUTION
   - All figures are saved at 300 DPI (publication quality)
   - Suitable for submission to journals
   - If you need higher resolution (600 DPI) or different format (TIFF, EPS), I can regenerate

5. ALTERNATIVE VISUALIZATION FOR FIGURE 1A
   If you want an even more dramatic visual for the career funnel:
   - Consider a Sankey diagram showing the flow from "interested" to "not interested" 
     and "placed in AS" vs "not placed in AS"
   - This would show all four quadrants of the relationship

6. DATA TRANSPARENCY
   Consider adding:
   - Sample size annotations on each bar/dot
   - Confidence intervals (if applicable)
   - Response rate information

7. ACCESSIBILITY
   Current color schemes should be colorblind-friendly, but consider:
   - Testing figures with colorblind simulation tools
   - Adding patterns/textures in addition to colors
   - Ensuring sufficient contrast for grayscale printing


NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Review the three figures and let me know if you'd like any adjustments:
   - Color scheme changes
   - Font sizes
   - Layout modifications
   - Additional annotations

2. I can create:
   - A composite figure with all three panels for a single-page layout
   - Alternative versions with different color schemes
   - Vector format versions (SVG, PDF) for easier editing in Illustrator

3. If you provide p-values or additional statistical data, I can add:
   - Significance markers
   - Confidence intervals
   - Additional annotations

4. I can also create supplementary figures if needed:
   - Detailed breakdown of curriculum content
   - Implementation methods comparison
   - Geographic distribution if available


TECHNICAL NOTES
===============

Script: /home/claude/create_figures.py
- Uses matplotlib and seaborn for publication-quality figures
- All data extracted directly from AS_Survey_Graphs.xlsx
- Easily modifiable for future updates or revisions
- Can regenerate figures with updated data in seconds

The Python script is well-commented and can be:
- Modified to adjust colors, sizes, or layout
- Extended to add more figures
- Used as a template for future data visualizations
- Integrated into your analysis pipeline


FILES CREATED
=============

1. Figure1_Leadership_Gap.png (323 KB)
   - Composite figure with career funnel and satisfaction diverging bar chart

2. Figure2_ASP_Interventions_Dumbbell.png (241 KB)
   - Dumbbell plot showing curriculum impact on interventions

3. Figure3_Barriers.png (165 KB)
   - Horizontal bar chart of barriers to education

All figures are in PNG format at 300 DPI, suitable for publication.


CONCLUSION
==========

These redesigned figures follow data visualization best practices:
- Use appropriate chart types for the data (diverging bar for Likert, dumbbell for comparisons)
- Emphasize the key findings through visual hierarchy
- Reduce cognitive load by removing unnecessary elements
- Tell a compelling story that supports your manuscript's argument

The figures now more powerfully communicate your central thesis: while fellows receive adequate foundational AS education, there is a significant gap in preparing them for AS leadership roles, and formal curricula appear to improve fellow engagement in AS interventions.
